		<p> As you stroll across the quiet Peruvian countryside, all you can see is sheep, hills, and more sheep. 
		As you glance at a particularly interesting sheep herd, you see some rowdy teenagers disturbing the sheep. 
		Then, seemingly out of nowhere, comes a colossal and magnificent beast with white fur that pummels the teenagers into the ground.
		After a while, the teenagers pick themselves up and run. The creature, known as a llama, snorts in disgust and walks away.
		</p>
		<p>
		Biologists classify llamas as Lama Glama, which implies this creature is part of a genus known as Lama. It shares the genus Lama with Lama Guanicoe, also know as the wild guanaco. 
		They are related to camels, although they do not have a hump and are only native to South America. Also, they are closely related to alpacas, which are notably smaller, and can succesfully cross-breed with them.
		Llamas are domesticated, unlike guanacos, and are mainly used by humans to carry heavy goods, although if overworked, a llama will sit down or attack its owner.
		Beware of its forms of attack, which can include biting, spitting, or kicking.
		</p>
		<p> A full-grown llama is about as tall as a human male. 
		Baby llamas are called crias and are protected in the large herds. The herds have a complicated hierarchy that ends with a head male, who has the important job of protecting the others.
		Llamas are very intelligent and can learn skills, like getting in and out of a car, in just a few tries. They communicate using humming, spitting, and body language.</p>
